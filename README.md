# Code Quiz


## Description
This application creates a javascript quiz, calculates your score, grabs your initials from you, then shows and stores your high scores.  When the quiz is run again, previous highscores will also be displayed.  This application stores all questions and answers in an array of objects, where each object is one question.  It includes a high scores button that allows you to see the high scores before you take the quiz (page must be refreshed to start the quiz after viewing the highscores).  It also includes a timer, set to 30 seconds that ticks while you take the quiz.  Once this timer reaches zero, an alert is given and the page must be reloaded.  If you get a question wrong, five seconds is deducted from the quiz and the timer flashes to indicate that the answer chosen was incorrect.
